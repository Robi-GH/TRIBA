      <h3>How to play:</h3>
      <p>
        The game consists of an m x n grid of points, where m and n are even natural numbers.
        Two players take turns playing alternately. 
        On each turn, a player selects a triangle by choosing three points from the grid that do not lie on the same straight line. 
        The triangles must not overlap, and no two triangles can share a vertex. 
        Triangles can, however, be nested within one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game ends when a player has no valid moves remaining. 
        The player unable to make a move loses.
